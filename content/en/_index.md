## Paul J.W. Schauenburg

Paul is an Amsterdam-based recorder player and composer with an interest in electronic music. As a performer, Paul has gained experience in both early and contemporary music during his recorder studies at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. In early music, he has especially played renaissance and medieval music with the trio “Le Réveil”, active 2018-2021, and since 2022 with [The Royal Wind Music](https://www.royalwindmusic.org). In new music, his interests are centered around minimalist electronic music.

<!-- Paul’s own music is most strongly influenced by minimal music, for example the music of Philip Glass. Other influences include modern composers such as Hildur Guðnadóttir, early music (baroque, renaissance, medieval), techno, house, and ambient music by artists such as Scanner. Most of Paul’s music includes an electronic component, which is usually done with the programming language SuperCollider. He is currently working to improve his knowledge of computer music and programming, with the help of his composition teacher Jorrit Tamminga. -->
