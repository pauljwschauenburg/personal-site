Introspection was written and performed in 2024 by Paul J.W. Schauenburg and [Þórður Hallgrímsson](https://soundcloud.com/r-ur-hallgr-msson). The piece makes use of a Paetzold contrabass recorder with a contact microphone on the inside, a microphone placed in the center of the hall, and live electronics (operated live by Þórður in the video).
