Periodic Orbits of Tetration for tenor recorder and electronics was written in 2023 by Paul J.W. Schauenburg. The electronics consist of a series of delays and pitch shifters, shifting the sound up by one octave with each one second delay. Different ways of rhythmical interlocking with this delay are used throughout the piece, with the live sound moving in and out of sync with the delayed sound.
