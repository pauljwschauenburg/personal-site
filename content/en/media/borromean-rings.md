Borromean Rings for basset recorder in f and electronics was written in early 2021 by Paul J.W. Schauenburg. The piece is based on a five-fold multi-tap delay in a regular rhythm. Simple melodic lines and arpeggi are timed in a way that creates an “echo counterpoint” throughout the piece. Different panning of each single delay creates changing panning patterns between the different delays throughout the piece, sometimes making successive events come from opposite sides, sometimes creating an illusion of movement.
