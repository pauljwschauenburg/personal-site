## Paul J.W. Schauenburg

Paul J.W. Schauenburg was born in 1998 in Munich, Germany. He began learning to play the recorder at the age of 6. From a young age, Paul learned not just to play the recorder, but also similar instruments such as the tabor pipe. This led to him playing traditional Irish music on tin whistle and recorder in a local Irish pub from ages 11-18, building a strong ability to play by ear and think quickly in music.

Since 2016, he has built on this eclectic foundation in his undergraduate studies in the recorder department of the Conservatorium van Amsterdam under main subject teacher Jorge Isaac. He is also taught by María Martínez Ayerza, Hester Groenleer, Erik Bosgraaf, and others. The broad curriculum of the department, which places equal emphasis on contemporary and early music, has been a fruitful place for Paul to explore his love of various musical styles, especially minimal and post-minimal music, electronic music, and his love for repetition in music from all eras.
