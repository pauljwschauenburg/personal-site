# Paul J. W. Schauenburg

Paul J. W. Schauenburg was born in 1998 in Munich, Germany. He began learning to play the recorder at the age of 6. From a young age, Paul learned not just to play the recorder, but also similar instruments such as the tabor pipe. This led to him playing traditional Irish music on tin whistle and recorder in a local Irish pub from ages 11-18, building a strong ability to play by ear and think quickly in music.

Since 2016, he has built on this eclectic foundation in his undergraduate studies in the recorder department of the Conservatorium van Amsterdam under main subject teacher Jorge Isaac. He is also taught by María Martínez Ayerza, Hester Groenleer, Erik Bosgraaf, and others. The broad curriculum of the department, which places equal emphasis on contemporary and early music, has been a fruitful place for Paul to explore his love of various musical styles, especially minimal and post-minimal music, electronic music, and his love for repetition in music from all eras.

Paul has been taking composition lessons with Meriç Artaç for the past two years, and writing music for himself and recorder ensemble. His compositions are oriented towards post-minimalism, and influenced by various types of electronic music. At the same time, he is learning to make use of computer programming in music. While taking lessons in Max/MSP in the conservatory, he is also working with the programming language SuperCollider, which he makes use of in his compositions.

Paul is a member of the recorder consort trio “Le Réveil”, together with Kristy van Dijk and Gabriel Belkheiri. As Le Réveil, they mainly perform renaissance and medieval music, but are expanding their repertoire towards contemporary music and playing Paul's original compositions.
